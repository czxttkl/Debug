    <string name="about_text">Debug is a reality-augmented game which encourages people exercise in a fun way. You will get enough sweat while using your feet to "burn" and "squash" bugs on the screen. &lt;br />&lt;br />All games have limitation. We have minimized the requirements of playing the game. Things you need to make sure before playing are:&lt;br />1. A good light condition while playing&lt;br />2. Sticky notes/markers of high contrast color with the floor.&lt;br />&lt;br />We are keen on having your feedback via email: &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=czxttkl@gmail.com" target="_blank">czxttkl@gmail.com&lt;/a>&lt;. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />Happy debugging!</string>
